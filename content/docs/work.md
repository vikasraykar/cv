[Microsoft Advertising](https://ads.microsoft.com/), [Microsoft AI](https://microsoft.ai/) \
*Microsoft, Bangalore, India* \
Jul 2021 to current (3 years 10 months)

Leading a team for multi-lingual and multi-modal models for dense retrieval and re-ranking for recommending product ads for paid search on bing.com for all international markets. Key focus areas include: computational advertising, transformers, teacher/student models, knowledge distillation, contrastive learning, fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, diversity in dense retrieval, auto-regressive dense retrieval models, product knowledge graph, query categorization, tokenizers, Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt engineering.

## IBM Research

**Senior Technical Staff Member & Manager** \
IBM Research AI for Supply Chain \
*IBM Research, Bangalore, India* \
Nov 2019 - Jun 2021 (1 year 8 months)

Technical lead and manager for IBM Research AI for Supply Chain - The IBM Research AI for Supply Chain project built state-of-the-art algorithms to enable intelligent self-correcting sustainable retail supply chains. The goal is to ensure that the right product is at the right location at the right time and at the right price.

**Senior Researcher** \
IBM Research AI \
IBM Research, Bangalore, India \
Nov 2012 - Oct 2019 (7 years)

*2016-2019* Technical lead for the [IBM Research AI for Fashion](https://cognitivefashion.github.io/) - The IBM Research AI for Fashion project has built a portfolio of APIs, assets, and use cases for the fashion and retail industry primarily leveraging deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing. The use cases are targeted towards end consumers, online retailers, buyers, merchandisers and designers and spans sell (front end customer experience), buy (back end merchandising and procurement) and creative design (fashion designers).

*2015-2016* Technical lead for the LingVist: A picture is worth a thousand words - The Far Reaching Research project LingVist: A picture is worth a thousand words aims to build a cognitive system that given an image can automatically and concisely summarize the salient content in the image in a few descriptive sentences.

*2012-2015* Technical lead from India for Project Debater-Project Debater is the first AI system that can debate humans on complex topics. It digests massive texts, constructs a well-structured speech on a given topic, delivers it with clarity and purpose, and rebuts its opponent. Eventually,
it will help people reason by providing compelling, evidence-based arguments and limiting the influence of emotion, bias, or ambiguity.
